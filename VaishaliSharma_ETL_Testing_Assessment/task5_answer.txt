1. Describe how you would perform data quality checks to ensure that the migrated data is accurate and complete.

Answer :

To ensure data migration accuracy and completeness, I would follow the below steps:

1. Pre-Migration Validations:
	i. Source-Target Schema Mapping: This will verify that the source and target schema are correctly mapped, including data types, constraints, and relationships.
   ii. Row Counts: This compares the total number of rows between the source and the target before migration begins.
  iii. Data Profiling: Will use SQL queries to assess the source data's quality.
2. During Migration:
	i. Record Counts in Batches: This check will monitor row counts transferred in each batch and compare with expected counts.
   ii. Data Profiling: Will use SQL queries to assess the target data's quality.
3. Post-Migration Validations:
	i. Reconciliation Testing: This will ensure that all records in the source system exist in the target system.
		a. Row Count Validation: This compares the number of rows in the source and target.
		b. Column-Level Validation: This validates specific column values to ensure data accuracy.
   ii. Boundary Condition Testing: This will test the data that falls on the edges of constraints, such as maximum or minimum values.
  iii. Null/Default Value Checks: This ensures no unintended null or default values appear in the target data.
   iv. Duplicate Data Validation: This verifies that there are no unexpected duplicates in the target system.
4. Automation of Checks:
	i. To improve the efficiency of these tests, I would also leverage automation frameworks (e.g. PyTest).
   ii. This can help in reducing the manual effort and chances of human error.
   
2. Outline a strategy for performance testing of the ETL process. Include considerations for handling large volumes of data and ensuring the ETL process completes within acceptable time frames.

Answer :

I would use the below strategy for Performance Testing of the ETL Process - 

1. Determine acceptable processing time for different data volumes.
2. Baseline Testing : Begin with small data sets to validate functionality.
3. Volume Testing : Gradually increase data size to simulate production-like loads.
4. Stress Testing : Push beyond expected volumes to identify failure points.
5. Spike Testing : Test the ETL with sudden, large data loads to measure responsiveness.
6. Optimize ETL performance by using partitioning, indexing and incrementaal load.
7. Keep track of database peformance by observing query execution time.
